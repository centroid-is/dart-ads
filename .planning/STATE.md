# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-03)

**Core value:** A Dart application can reliably connect to a Beckhoff PLC and read, write, and subscribe to variables over ADS — with wire behavior verified byte-for-byte against the reference C++ implementation.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Protocol Framing, Codecs & C++ Golden-Frame Harness

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Protocol Framing, Codecs & C++ Golden-Frame Harness) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 7

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: strict bottom-up dependency chain (framing → transport → commands → router → notifications/sum → symbols → CLI → publishing) is technically load-bearing, not arbitrary.
- Roadmap: C++ CMake mock + golden-frame harness comes online in Phase 1 so codec parity is validated before any socket code exists.
- Roadmap: notifications (Phase 5) and sum commands (Phase 6) split into independent branches on top of Phase 4 (fine granularity, parallelizable).
- [Phase 01]: Pinned Beckhoff/ADS submodule to verified commit 57d63747; re-verify the 4-source build recipe before any re-pin — Reproducible mock-server/dumper build; RESEARCH verified this exact commit compiles

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Three phases carry research flags to resolve during planning:

- Phase 1: AdsLib public-header surface for a C++ server role + cross-platform CMake build (macOS dev vs Linux CI).
- Phase 4: AddRoute UDP :48899 handshake (least-documented protocol area) — confirm scope before committing.
- Phase 5: notification handle lifecycle on reconnect (onCancel + disconnect + reconnect state machine).
